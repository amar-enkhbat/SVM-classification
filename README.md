# SVM-classification-without-scikit-learn
This repository is not intended for use. I only made this to further understand how Support Vector Machine(SVM) or Machine Learning (ML) in general works.
I'm not even sure if this works correctly. Lot of things needs to be done in order to use this code as a basis for educational machine learning code. 

Things that needs to be implemented:
 - Kernel
 - Quadratic Programming
 - Proper cost function and Gradient Descent
 - Cleaner code
