# SVM-classification-without-scikit-learn
This repository do is not intended for practical use. I only made this to further understand how Support Vector Machine(SVM) or Machine Learning (ML) in general works.
I'm not even sure if this is working correctly, a lot of things needs to be done in order to use this code as a basis for educational machine learning code. 
Things that needs to be implemented:
 - Kernel
 - Quadratic Programming
 - Proper cost function and Gradient Descent
 - Cleaner code
